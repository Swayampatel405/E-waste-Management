            <br>
            3.Recycling and Recovery: Extracting valuable materials like metals, plastics, and glass from e-waste and processing them for reuse in manufacturing.
            <br>
            4.Safe Disposal: Ensuring that non-recyclable and hazardous components are disposed of safely, preventing environmental contamination.
            <br>
            5.Refurbishing and Reuse: Repairing and refurbishing functional electronics for resale or donation to extend their lifecycle.
            <br>
            6.Legislation and Compliance: Adhering to local, national, and international laws and regulations governing e-waste management.
            <br>

        <h4> Here are few steps which we can follow in order to minimize food wastage: <br>
            1) Reduce food waste at home by buying only what you need, planning meals, and storing food properly. <br>
            2) Compost food scraps to create nutrient-rich soil for plants. <br>
            3) Donate extra food to food banks, shelters, and other organizations. <br>
            4) Recycle food packaging and containers.  <br>
            5) Use leftovers creatively in new meals and recipes. <br>
            6) Contact your local government to find out what food waste programs are available in your area. <br> <br>
            
            Solutions for food waste management in India: <br>
           
            1)<span>Recycle by Composting:</span> Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you don’t have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production. <br>

            2)<span>Turn Wasted Food into Animal Feed:</span> Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food). <br>

            3)<span>Use Waste Food to provide Products:</span> From biofuels to liquid fertilizer, there are several helpful merchandises that may be factory-made from bound styles of waste foods, and infrequently “leftovers” of one company might be helpful in another business for the food scrap. <br>

            4)<span>Source Reduction and Food Donation:</span> The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly resulting in waste.
